### 2025-01-26 - Generation Service with Priority Queuing

**Change Type**: Backend/Infrastructure

**Summary**: Implemented dedicated generation service with priority queuing to prevent thread starvation and enable tiered pricing.

**Rationale**: 
- Test generation was blocking all web server threads, causing WebSocket failures
- Health checks were timing out during generation
- Progress updates were impossible due to thread starvation
- Need foundation for future tiered pricing based on priority levels

**Implementation**:
- Created `app/services/generation_service.py` with priority queue system
- Implemented separate thread pool for generation workers (2 threads)
- Added priority levels: HIGH, NORMAL, LOW for future pricing tiers
- Enhanced uvicorn configuration: 2 workers √ó 4 threads = 8 web threads
- Increased Fly.io resources: 2GB RAM, 2 CPUs
- Added comprehensive monitoring via `/status` endpoint
- Integrated with existing WebSocket progress tracking

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ **Thread Starvation Prevention**: Web requests always served during generation
- ‚úÖ **Scalable Priority System**: Foundation for tiered pricing
- ‚úÖ **Better Resource Utilization**: Optimal thread allocation (8 web + 2 generation)
- ‚úÖ **Real-time Progress**: WebSocket updates work reliably
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Service metrics and status tracking
- ‚úÖ **Future-proof**: Easy user-based priority assignment
- ‚úÖ **Health Check Reliability**: Health checks never blocked by generation

**Cons**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Increased Complexity**: More moving parts to maintain and debug
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Higher Resource Usage**: 2GB RAM vs 1GB, 2 CPUs vs 1
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Higher Costs**: Increased Fly.io resource allocation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Potential Race Conditions**: More complex async interactions
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Memory Pressure**: Higher baseline memory usage

**Impact**:
- WebSocket connections establish immediately, even during generation
- Progress indicators work reliably with real-time updates
- Health checks respond quickly regardless of generation load
- Foundation for implementing tiered pricing in the future
- Better user experience with non-blocking UI

**Migration**:
- **Deployment**: Requires Fly.io app restart for new configuration
- **Environment Variables**: New vars in `fly.toml` and `app/config.py`
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing API endpoints unchanged
- **Monitoring**: New `/status` endpoint provides visibility

### 2024-01-XX - Progress Tracking System Implementation

**Change Type**: Frontend/Backend Integration

**Summary**: Implemented comprehensive progress tracking system with WebSocket-based real-time updates and visual progress indicators.

**Rationale**: 
- Users need visibility into long-running generation processes
- Current synchronous approach provides no feedback during generation
- Hybrid AI provider takes 30-60 seconds and users need progress updates

**Implementation**:
- Added WebSocket progress tracking (`/ws/{task_id}` endpoint)
- Implemented visual progress steps with colored dots
- Created asynchronous generation flow with background tasks
- Added progress bar and step-by-step indicators
- Implemented download endpoint for completed tasks

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Real-time progress updates via WebSocket
- ‚úÖ Visual feedback with colored step indicators
- ‚úÖ Better user experience during long operations
- ‚úÖ Non-blocking UI during generation
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive progress tracking in E2E tests
- ‚úÖ Proper error handling and fallback mechanisms

**Cons**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Increased complexity with WebSocket management
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Additional state management for task tracking
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential for WebSocket connection issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è More complex error handling scenarios
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires proper cleanup of temporary files

**Impact**:
- Frontend now supports both synchronous and asynchronous modes
- Backend has new WebSocket endpoints and task management
- E2E tests include comprehensive progress validation
- Download mechanism changed from direct response to task-based

**Migration**:
- Frontend JavaScript updated to handle both modes
- WebSocket manager added for task state management
- Progress tracking integrated into existing UI components
- E2E tests enhanced with progress validation

### 2024-01-XX - Hybrid AI Provider Implementation

**Change Type**: AI/Backend Logic

**Summary**: Implemented hybrid approach combining null provider speed with AI intelligence for enhanced test case generation.

**Rationale**:
- Pure AI generation was too slow and unreliable
- Null provider was fast but lacked domain-specific intelligence
- Need balance between speed and quality

**Implementation**:
- Created `HybridProvider` class combining null and AI providers
- Null provider generates foundation cases quickly
- AI provider enhances cases with domain-specific values
- Fallback to foundation cases if AI enhancement fails

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Much faster than pure AI generation (1-3 minutes vs 5-10 minutes)
- ‚úÖ More reliable with fallback mechanisms
- ‚úÖ Better domain-specific test cases
- ‚úÖ Maintains speed while adding intelligence
- ‚úÖ Graceful degradation if AI fails

**Cons**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è More complex provider logic
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Still depends on AI availability for enhancement
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires careful balance between foundation and enhanced cases
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Additional testing complexity

**Impact**:
- Generation process now has two phases (foundation + enhancement)
- Progress tracking shows multiple stages
- Test case quality improved with domain-specific values
- Generation time significantly reduced

**Migration**:
- Updated provider selection logic
- Modified progress tracking for multi-phase generation
- Enhanced test cases with domain-specific validation
- Updated UI to reflect hybrid approach
