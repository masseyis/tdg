## Recent Changes

### 2024-01-XX - Progress Tracking System Implementation

**Change Type**: Frontend/Backend Integration

**Summary**: Implemented comprehensive progress tracking system with WebSocket-based real-time updates and visual progress indicators.

**Rationale**: 
- Users need visibility into long-running generation processes
- Current synchronous approach provides no feedback during generation
- Hybrid AI provider takes 30-60 seconds and users need progress updates

**Implementation**:
- Added WebSocket progress tracking (`/ws/{task_id}` endpoint)
- Implemented visual progress steps with colored dots
- Created asynchronous generation flow with background tasks
- Added progress bar and step-by-step indicators
- Implemented download endpoint for completed tasks

**Pros**:
- ✅ Real-time progress updates via WebSocket
- ✅ Visual feedback with colored step indicators
- ✅ Better user experience during long operations
- ✅ Non-blocking UI during generation
- ✅ Comprehensive progress tracking in E2E tests
- ✅ Proper error handling and fallback mechanisms

**Cons**:
- ⚠️ Increased complexity with WebSocket management
- ⚠️ Additional state management for task tracking
- ⚠️ Potential for WebSocket connection issues
- ⚠️ More complex error handling scenarios
- ⚠️ Requires proper cleanup of temporary files

**Impact**:
- Frontend now supports both synchronous and asynchronous modes
- Backend has new WebSocket endpoints and task management
- E2E tests include comprehensive progress validation
- Download mechanism changed from direct response to task-based

**Migration**:
- Frontend JavaScript updated to handle both modes
- WebSocket manager added for task state management
- Progress tracking integrated into existing UI components
- E2E tests enhanced with progress validation

### 2024-01-XX - Hybrid AI Provider Implementation

**Change Type**: AI/Backend Logic

**Summary**: Implemented hybrid approach combining null provider speed with AI intelligence for enhanced test case generation.

**Rationale**:
- Pure AI generation was too slow and unreliable
- Null provider was fast but lacked domain-specific intelligence
- Need balance between speed and quality

**Implementation**:
- Created `HybridProvider` class combining null and AI providers
- Null provider generates foundation cases quickly
- AI provider enhances cases with domain-specific values
- Fallback to foundation cases if AI enhancement fails

**Pros**:
- ✅ Much faster than pure AI generation (1-3 minutes vs 5-10 minutes)
- ✅ More reliable with fallback mechanisms
- ✅ Better domain-specific test cases
- ✅ Maintains speed while adding intelligence
- ✅ Graceful degradation if AI fails

**Cons**:
- ⚠️ More complex provider logic
- ⚠️ Still depends on AI availability for enhancement
- ⚠️ Requires careful balance between foundation and enhanced cases
- ⚠️ Additional testing complexity

**Impact**:
- Generation process now has two phases (foundation + enhancement)
- Progress tracking shows multiple stages
- Test case quality improved with domain-specific values
- Generation time significantly reduced

**Migration**:
- Updated provider selection logic
- Modified progress tracking for multi-phase generation
- Enhanced test cases with domain-specific validation
- Updated UI to reflect hybrid approach
