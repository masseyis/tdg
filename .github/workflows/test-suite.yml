name: Comprehensive Test Suite

# ⚠️  CRITICAL NOTES TO SELF:
# 1. ALL TESTS MUST RUN WITH COVERAGE AND PASS BEFORE DEPLOYMENT
# 2. The e2e test is the most important - it validates the complete user journey
# 3. The post-deploy test must fully mimic user behavior, just like the e2e test does
# 4. The post-deploy test must ALWAYS run against the deployed site
# 5. This workflow consolidates all testing into one comprehensive suite
